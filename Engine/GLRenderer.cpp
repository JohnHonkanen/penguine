I declare that the following code was produced by Lars Anthony Palm, John Christopher Arnon Honkanen as a group assignment for the GED module and that this is our own work.

I am aware of the penalties incurred by submitting in full or in part work that is not our own and that was developed by third parties that are not appropriately acknowledged.
